EVS - EVolutionary Server:
An application for separating evaluation from evolution

===========================================================

See DESCRIPTION for comments on the program's architecture.

To run the program on Linux or Mac, open two terminals, 
change working directory to where this file is (e.g., by 
"cd ~/evs-master") on both and run the server by typing 

$ python main.py

in the first terminal and the client by

$ python tests/testFloatVectorWUnixPipe.py

in the second. In the first terminal you'll see the best 
individual of each generation evolution made so far. 

Notes:
 - on some Linux distros you might want to use the 
   "python2" command instead of "python";
 - the only way to stop the program in its current version 
   is to press Ctrl+C in the terminal;
 - the program (main.py) automatically creates two pipes 
   named individuals.pipe and evaluations.pipe in its 
   working directory. You can delete or keep those, it 
   won't affect the program's execution.
